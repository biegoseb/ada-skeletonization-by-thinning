# Partial Project

Medical imaging refers to the technologies and algorithms used to create structures or images of different parts of the human body for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Nowadays is highly used to avoid invasive medical procedures and the field is always open to new proposals. Concretely we are gonna research methods and techniques that lie under the shape descriptor and image exploration subfields.

The purpose of this project is to research and apply asymptotic analysis techniques to evaluate the performance of different algorithms and programming paradigms. Below you will find the list of proposed jobs considered in this project:

- Skeletonization by general fields
- Skeletonization by thinning
- Skeletonization by geometric approaches
- Skeletonization by distance 
- Distance transform
- Poisson Disk Sampling

Each of the proposed jobs above is assigned to a research team conformed by at most 5 persons. Each team should produce a research paper, a presentation and slides accompanying it. The research paper and the slides should be 2 separated PDF files, optionally the presentation and the paper should follow the same structure. Your final research paper must contain the following sections: Abstract, Introduction, Related Works, Proposal ( if any ), Experiments and Results, Conclusions. 

If your team generates a Proposal, the subject could be an improvement to a specific method or an improvement to a specific problem. Otherwise your research should focus on the comparative  and exhaustive analysis of the algorithms that are grouped in the proposed job assigned.

During your research consider that the most important aspect of this project is the analysis of the different algorithms that you will find, the paper and the presentation are just formal mechanisms to expose your findings.


## Starting Point

1. Identify the general purpose of the proposed job and get information about the related works. For this you can start searching information about related surveys, a survey contains the process of collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions about a topic.
2. Once the information is collected, then we need to iterate in the objectives of the research and be clear about what we want to accomplish.
3. As soon as we identify the scope of our research we need to start with the development of the process needed to produce the paper and presentation based on the analysis of the algorithms collected.
